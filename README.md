INTRODUCTION:
The broad goal of vehicle dynamics is to maximize time as close as possible to the G-G boundary

The "G-G" measurements can be graphed with lateral acceleration on one graph and longitudinal acceleration on the other
The "G-G boundary" is how far you can push the vehicle maximiizing total lateral and longitudinal acceleration

The side goal of vehicle dynamics is to optimize the cars handling around the driver to ensure safety and driver confidence
